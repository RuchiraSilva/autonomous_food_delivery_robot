# Autonomous Food Delivery Robot 🤖

This project demonstrates an **Autonomous Food Delivery Robot** designed to streamline restaurant operations by automating food delivery. The robot navigates autonomously, avoids obstacles, and delivers food to designated tables while being controlled and monitored through a web-based interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses encoder feedback, orientation data from the MPU6050 IMU, and trigonometric calculations to navigate to target locations.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time.
- **Web-Based Interface**:
  - Customer-facing interface for selecting table destinations.
  - Real-time monitoring of the robot's location, battery percentage, and status.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Continuously measures and displays the battery charge level.
- **Scalable Design**: Can be expanded to handle multiple robots or larger restaurant environments.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

The robot is built using the following components:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Acts as the brain of the robot.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Controls the DC gear motors.
- **DC Gear Motors**: Provide motion for the robot.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects obstacles in the robot's path.
- **MPU6050 IMU**: Provides orientation data for navigation.
- **Encoders**: Measure wheel rotation for precise movement control.
- **18650 Batteries and Buck Converter**: Power the entire system and ensure stable voltage.

## 💻 Software Components

The software integrates both hardware control and web-based interfaces:

- **ESP32 Web Server**: Hosts a lightweight web page for controlling the robot and monitoring its status.
- **Navigation Logic**: Implements algorithms for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Web Interface**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.

## 🚀 How to Set Up

### Prerequisites

- Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Add the ESP32 board support to the Arduino IDE ([Instructions here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide/)).
- Install required libraries:
  - `Wire.h`
  - `MPU6050_light.h`
  - `WiFi.h`
  - `WebServer.h`

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RuchiraSilva/autonomous-food-delivery-robot.git
   ```

2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Update the Wi-Fi credentials in the code:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
   const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";
   ```

4. Upload the code to your ESP32 microcontroller.

5. Power up the robot and connect to the ESP32's Wi-Fi network.

6. Access the web interface by navigating to the ESP32's IP address in your browser.
